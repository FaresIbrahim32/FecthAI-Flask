This is a Flask full stack app that leverages Fetch AI's LLM for a chatbot using deltav4 API . The app itself is a football stats app that prompts the user for their favorite team and then outputs recent matches for that team, along with other stats like top goalscoerers in the top 5 leagues. The LLM is used as a helper plugin for stats the API doesn't fetch ( e.g. Who's the all time scorer for Inter ?)  . This is done using football-data.org API . You need a Fetch Ai API to use the llm and another API from football-data
